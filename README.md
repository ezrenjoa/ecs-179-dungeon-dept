## Synopsis
Itâ€™s your very first day as a dungeon master! The gates are opening tomorrow and hoards of adventurers are coming for your treasure. Set up your defenses by placing monsters and traps to thwart the adventurers.

## Gameplay
Different levels with limited build points. Spend build points to place down defenses. Start when ready and adventurers will spawn and try to get through your defenses to reach a goal (the treasure). Levels get progressively harder.
