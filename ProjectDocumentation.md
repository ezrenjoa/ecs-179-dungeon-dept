## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**


**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer

Typical items include group scheduling mechanisms, links to meeting notes, descriptions of team logistics problems with their resolution, project organization tools (e.g., timelines, dependency/task tracking, Gantt charts, etc.), and repository management methodology.**
